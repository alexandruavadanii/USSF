I wrote this about 10 years ago learning AutoIt, when I was playing
with Windows automation and had no real programming experience.

I am no longer maintaining this (obviously), so if you want to do
something with it, fork it and post your work on MSFN forums [1],
where it originated.

Thanks MSFN for the fun I had working on this, it surely brings up
memories :)

# AutoIt compatibility
Check [2] for a full list of changes in AutoIt that might require
updating the code; or just use an older version of AutoIt.

A quick look at [2] indicates that AutoIt 3.3.6 or newer requires
at least:
- include new-style headers (EditConstants, ComboConstants etc.);
- rewrite or remove code using "InetGetActive";
